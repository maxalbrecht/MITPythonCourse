WEEK 4, LECTURE 8

VIDEO 1

"Today, we're going to talk about the use of exceptions
and the use of assertions, both to accomplish defensive
programming and to elt you actually control how the
computer reacts when something goes in an unexpected
way."

What happens when procedure execution hits an unexpected
condition?
-> you get an exception... to what was excpeted.
e.g.:

*trying to access beyong list limits
    test = [1,7,4]
    test[4]
    -> IndexError
*trying to convert an inappropriate type
    int(test)
    -> TypeError
*referencing a non-existing variable
    a
    ->NameError
*mixing data types without coercion
    'a'/4
    -> TypeError
