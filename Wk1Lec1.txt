Dictionaries

* A dictionary is going to have elements indexed by a key (label)

* A python dictionary sotres pairs of day: 
    a key
    a value

TO CREATE A NEW DICTIONARY:
    e.g.:
        grades = {'Ana':'B', 'John':'A+', 'Denise':'A', 'Katy':'A'}
        
        print(grades['John']) #prints A+
###

To ADD an entry:
    e.g. cont'd from above:
    
        grades['Sylvan'] = 'A'
        print(grades['Sylvan']) # prints A
###

To CHECK if entry is in the dictionary:
        
'John' in grades # returns True
'Daniel'  in grades # returns False
###

To DELETE from a dictionary:
    del(grades['Ana'])
###

To get a "list" of the keys in the dictionary
        grades.keys() # returns ['Denise', 'Katy', 'John', 'Ana']
###

To get a "list" of the values in the dictionary:
        grades.values() # returns ['A', 'A', 'A+', 'B']
###

* values
    can be any type (immutable and mutable)
    can be duplicates
    dictionary values can be lists, even other dictionaries!
    
* keys
    must be  UNIQUE
    IMMUTABLE type (int, float, string, tuple, bool)
        Actually need an object that is HASHABLE, but you can think of it
        as immutable since all immutable types are hashable
    CAREFULL with float type as a key
    
* NO ORDER to keys or values!

###

 LIST vs DICTIONARY
 
    list
    
    * ordered sequence of elements
    * look up elements by an interger index
    * indices have an order
    * index is an interger
    
    dictionary
    
    * matches "keys" to "values"
    * look up one item by another item
    * no order is guaranteed
    * key can be any immutable type

Example with a Dictionary

Task: 
1) create a frequency dictionary mapping str:int
2) find the word that occurs the most and how many times
    * use a list, in case there is more than word
    * return a tuple (list, int) for (wods_list, highest_freq)
3) find the words that occur at least X times
    * let the user choose "at least X times", so allow as parameter
    * return a lsit of tuples, each tuple is a (list, int)
      containing the list of words ordered by thier frequency
    * IDEA: From song dictioary, find the most frequent word.
            Delete the most common word.Repeat. It works because you are
            mutating the song dictionary
